<h3>
    *Welcome to PuppyChow, where dogs roam free and always beg you for food. PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE DOGS!!!!! Their
    begging is for your enjoyment.
    We provide the freshest of ingredients. Nothing is frozen. The Puppy's and dogs around the cafe are for your
    enjoyment, purchase some treats
    and teach the dogs how to sit. If they are being good dogs, purchase them a pup cup. The dogs will welcome you
    whenever you come.*
